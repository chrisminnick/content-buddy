# Five Minute Guide to API Security

APIs are the backbone of modern applications, but they're also prime targets for attackers. Here's what every developer needs to know about API security.

## Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication**: "Who are you?" - Verifying user identity
- **Authorization**: "What can you do?" - Controlling access to resources

Common authentication methods:

- API keys (simple but limited)
- OAuth 2.0 (industry standard)
- JWT tokens (stateless and scalable)

## Input Validation

Never trust user input. Always:

- Validate data types and formats
- Check for SQL injection patterns
- Limit input sizes to prevent DoS
- Sanitize special characters

## Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting to prevent:

- Brute force attacks
- API abuse
- Accidental DoS from buggy clients

Common strategies:

- Token bucket algorithm
- Fixed window counters
- Sliding window logs

## HTTPS Everywhere

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Validate SSL certificates
- Use HSTS headers
- Consider certificate pinning for mobile apps

## Security Headers

Essential HTTP security headers:

- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `X-Frame-Options`
- `X-Content-Type-Options`
- `Strict-Transport-Security`

## Error Handling

- Don't expose stack traces
- Use generic error messages
- Log detailed errors securely
- Implement proper HTTP status codes

Remember: Security is not optionalâ€”it's fundamental to building trustworthy APIs.
